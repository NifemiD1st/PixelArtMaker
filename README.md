# Experience 
I have acquired a lot of experience during my ALCwithGoogle scholarship on Udacity and more during the collaboration on slack with my co-learners. I only didn't acquire relevant knowledge to be a world class developer but I was also given the opportunity to collaborate, teach, correct, fix bugs of my other colleagues accross Africa and at the same time receive corrections and learn from them along the journey. Not only have I learn't relevant basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript but I also have learnt how to manipulate the DOM with Javascript and jQuery and I also have the feeling that I can now build an interactive web page.

# Appreciation 
I'd really like to appreciate Google, ALC and Udacity for endowing me this one time opportunity of learning Frontend Web Development on Udacity. It has really been a life changing event for me. The knowledge I have acquired during the scholarship has really given my career the foundation to push my career to greater heights to achieve more for myself and also adding value back to my community. Secondly, I have been able to meet and make friends across Africa through collaborating with them on slack. That experience in itself is priceless to me. Thank you so so  much. You all have been AWESOME! Hopefully I am believing to make it to the Second Phase (NanoDegree) of the scholarship.
